                    <p>Working in an office is almost all I've ever known.</p>
                    <p>
                        When I was little I saw how my father spent at least a
                        third of his day inside one. When my mom wasn't
                        teaching, she was also behind a desk, buried under
                        paperwork. Desks, chairs, printers, folders - these
                        were as familiar to me as playgrounds and cartoons.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I remember one time in school when we were trying to
                        decide whose parent we should invite as guest speaker
                        to talk about their profession. Naturally, everyone
                        wanted a firefighter, a doctor or pilot. Someone that
                        would tell us cool stories.
                    </p>
                    <p>But there were none of those amongst our parents.</p>
                    <p>Most of them worked in offices.</p>
                    <p>
                        I got my first job when I was 21 years old. And yes,
                        you guessed it - it was at an office. The very same one
                        my father worked in. I started as an intern. Sitting at
                        a desk that looked the same as the next one. Even after
                        I moved on from that company I kept working behind a
                        desk.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The following years my life followed the same pendulum
                        swing; work, save money, travel, go back to work. And
                        while I was grateful - the money was good, the job was
                        stable - I also felt trapped.
                    </p>
                    <p>And I felt guilty about feeling trapped.</p>
                    <p>
                        But everyone around me was doing the same thing. This
                        was normal. This was success. So why did I keep
                        thinking, "There has to be something else out there for
                        me... something better"?
                    </p>
                    <p>Then COVID happened.</p>
                    <p>
                        Like many of you, I got my first real taste of working
                        from home during the pandemic. At first it felt great!
                        almost illegal - like I was getting away with
                        something. No commute. No awkward small talk. Pants
                        became optional. Not that I dressed up too much for
                        work anyways.
                    </p>
                    <p>That's when the little itch started.</p>
                    <p>
                        "Huh," I thought. "This home office thing ain't
                        half-bad. I wonder if..."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That thought grew louder as I started reading story
                        after story online about people working remotely while
                        traveling the world. At first, it sounded unrealistic.
                        Then irresponsible. Then... possible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This year I decided I want that. Not because I hate
                        offices - but because I don't want my life to be
                        limited to one chair, one building, one view out the
                        same window. I want my work to fit into my life, not
                        the other way around.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I don't have all the answers, I don't know where this
                        road leads. But for the first time, instead of asking
                        for something better, I'll go out there and seize the
                        chance to find out for myself.
                    </p>
                    <p>And that feels like the right place to start.</p>

                    <p>
                        Just to be clear - this isn't me antagonizing office
                        workers, or pretending that office jobs are dull or
                        meaningless. I'm still doing the same kind of work;
                        sitting behind a computer, staring at a screen,
                        drinking coffee, all that good stuff. I just don't do
                        it in an office anymore. I found the whole corporate
                        setting just wasn't for me.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the end, we did manage to get a "cool" guest speaker
                        for that class. We invited a police officer. He showed
                        up in his captain's uniform, which immediately made him
                        the most interesting adult in the room - no offence to
                        my teacher at the time. He told us stories, answered
                        questions, and - most importantly - showed us his gun,
                        which was pretty awesome in itself.
                    </p>

                        If you have any questions about me, my story, or this
                        whole journey I'm about to begin, feel free to reach
                        out. You can find me on X or Instagram - I'm always
                        happy to talk, share, or answer anything you're curious
                        about.
